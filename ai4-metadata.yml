title: Diatom classification at the species level
summary: "Diatoms classification at the species level using Yolov8-cls of Ultralytics."
description: |-
  diamorph_classification is an application using the DEEPaaS API.

  It is designed to classify individual diatoms at the species level. 

  The provided image is expected to be 512x512 at a scale of 0.1 µm/pixel .

  This preprocessing can be performed using the `square-pad.py` script provided
  on the github repository. In any case, in the current version of deployed application,
  you **must** perform this pre-preprocessing on your side.

  Also, in the currently deployed version of the application, you must adapt the parameters on the gradio interface. The image size must be set to 512.

  It is based on a pre-trained yolov8-cls that has been finetuned on manually labeled data.

  This application only provides the inference endpoint.

  **History and contributors**

  The project was initiated by the PhD of Aishwarya Venkataramanan using YoloV5 working on both detection and classification [1], cosupervized by Cédric Pradalier and Martin Laviale. Aisharya developed a hierarchical classification system. Thanks to the support of PNRIA (Programme National de Recherche en Intelligence Artificielle) and the work of Cyril Regan, the code base was improved [2]. The project was finally ported
  to the iMagine platform with Yolov8 by Jeremy Fix. This ported code does not yet support hierarchical classification.

  The database used to train the Yolov8 is made of Atlas images of single individuals. After excluding classes with fewer than 10 images, the datasets comprised 108 classes at the genus level (ranging from 11 to 4527 images/class) and 548 classes (ranging from 11 to 395 images/class) at the species level.
